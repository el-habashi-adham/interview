# 📚 KnowledgeGraph – Internal Documentation Intelligence

> _"Knowledge is the backbone of creating anything meaningful."_

But here’s the reality: in most companies, knowledge lives everywhere **except where you need it**.  
It’s scattered across Slack threads, Notion pages, Confluence docs, GitHub issues… and finding the right answer often feels like searching for treasure without a map.

## 🌍 Why This Matters

I came across a stat that really hit me:

👉 On average, employees spend **almost 20% of their work time just searching for information**.  
That’s basically **one full day every week**.

Translate that into money, and you’re looking at **hundreds of thousands of dollars lost annually** for mid-sized teams.

## 💡 The Idea: KnowledgeGraph

Instead of letting valuable tribal knowledge slip through the cracks, what if we could:

- 🔎 **Connect the dots automatically**
- 📖 **Make every doc, conversation, and snippet searchable**
- 🕸️ **Visualize knowledge as a living, breathing network**

That’s the vision behind **KnowledgeGraph**.

## 🚀 What I Built

For this project, I focused on the core foundation of the idea:

- 📊 **Dashboard** – Metrics on docs indexed, questions answered, time saved, and knowledge health.
- 🔎 **Smart Search** – Natural language Q&A across multiple sources (Slack, Notion, GitHub, Confluence).
- 🕸️ **Knowledge Graph** – An interactive visualization showing how topics, people, and documents connect.

## 🔮 What’s Next

This demo shows the foundations — but there are plenty of directions to take it further:

- 🤖 **Smarter Search** → semantic or vector search for deeper understanding, not just fuzzy text.
- 📝 **Knowledge Curation** → let users upvote/edit answers and enrich docs over time.
- 🎯 **Personalization** → recommend content or topics based on a user’s role or history.
- 💬 **Collaboration Features** → comments, mentions, and shared collections of docs.
- 🔗 **Integrations** → hook into Slack, Notion, Confluence, or GitHub for live data instead of mocked JSON.
- 📊 **Analytics Expansion** → trends in unanswered questions, “knowledge gaps” detection.
- 📈 **Scalability** → handle larger datasets with graph clustering, pagination, and caching.
